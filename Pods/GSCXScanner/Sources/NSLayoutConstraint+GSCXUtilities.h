 * @param horizontalFormat The format of constraints in the horizontal direction. One of @c

 * @param verticalFormat The format of constraints in the vertical direction. One of @c
 * horizontalFormat and @c verticalFormat must be non-nil. Does not need to contain the "V:" prefix.

 * the visual format string. Used for both @c horizontalFormat and @c verticalFormat.

 * dictionaryâ€™s keys must be the string values used in the visual format string. Their values must
 * be @c NSNumber objects.
 * @param views A dictionary of views that appear in the visual format string. The keys must be the
 * string values used in the visual format string, and the values must be the view objects.
 * @param activated @c YES if the returned constraints should be activated, @c NO otherwise.
